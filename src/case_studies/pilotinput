Information flow analysis has emerged as a key tool for understanding
how well programs protect the confidentiality of sensitive data and
prevent untrusted inputs from compromising security.  Early work on
information flow analysis typically tried to provide absolute isolation
between untrusted and trusted components. 

Quantitative Information Flow (QIF) analysis was developed to quantify
the amount of information leaked by programs.  The standard approach
is to first classify the high security input into equivalence classes
and then to apply model generation and counting techniques to
calculate the information leakage.
